    "title": "Sirr Has Verifiable Security",
    "content": "Sirr uses the OpenPGP encryption standard to provide end-to-end encryption for all user communications. OpenPGP was born in 1991, against the backdrop of governments beginning mass surveillance of electronic communications. Its founder Zimmermann's goal was to enable ordinary people to use military-grade encryption to protect communication freedom. Later, the core ideas of PGP were organized into an open standard that belongs to no company or government, maintained by global developers. Its open standards are RFC4880/4880bis. OpenPGP does not rely on central servers, requires no CA (Certificate Authority), and each person owns their own keys and is responsible for them. Encryption happens on the client side, keys are never uploaded to servers - the server is just a \"blind messenger\". Even if all servers are compromised, attackers can only see encrypted gibberish. OpenPGP's algorithms are public, protocols are open, and implementations have been continuously reviewed by the global cryptography community for 30 years. This is the source of verifiable security. Even if Sirr ceases to exist one day, users can still decrypt their historical messages. Therefore, Sirr is designed for long-term, serious, secure communication."

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": {
      "question": "How does the decentralized account work?",
      "answer": "Your BSC wallet address serves as your account. No registration required - just connect your wallet or create a new one. You have complete ownership of your identity, secured by your private key."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "What can I do with the built-in wallet?",
      "answer": "The built-in BSC wallet lets you manage BNB and BEP-20 tokens, send instant transfers to contacts, create and claim red packets, and view transaction history - all without leaving the app."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "How do red packets work?",
      "answer": "Red packets let you share crypto with friends in chats. Create a red packet with BNB or tokens, send it to a chat, and recipients can tap to claim. Great for celebrations, tips, or community rewards."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Are my messages and transactions secure?",
      "answer": "Yes! Messages are end-to-end encrypted using OpenPGP. Wallet transactions are secured by BSC blockchain. Your private keys never leave your device, giving you full control."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What tokens are supported?",
      "answer": "Sirr supports BNB (native token) and all BEP-20 tokens on BSC, including USDT, USDC, BUSD, and many others. You can add any custom BEP-20 token by its contract address."
